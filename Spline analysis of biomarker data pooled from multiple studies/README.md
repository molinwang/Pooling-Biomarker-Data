# Spline analysis of biomarker data pooled from multiple studies

The  R functions are for evaluating the biomarkerâ€”disease association when the continuous biomarker data are pooled from multiple matched/nested case-control studies and their measurements vary across laboratories and assays. The statistical method allows a nonlinear relationship between the biomarker exposure and the disease risk, and can be used to estimate the dose-response curves. A calibration study is required for each sub-study.
