This repository contains R programs implementing the statistical methods from five papers on pooling biomarker data, published by Dr. Molin Wang's group. Each of the five folders in the main branch contains the same files as those in the non-main branches. You can either look at the files in the folders in the main branch or view the files from the other branches.
