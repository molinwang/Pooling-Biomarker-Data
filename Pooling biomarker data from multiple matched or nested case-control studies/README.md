# Pooling biomarker data from multiple matched/nested case-control studies

The functions incorporate the calibration process for a continuous biomarker exposure in pooled data analyses based on the conditional logistic regression models. A calibration study is required for each sub-study in the pooled data-aggregation analyses of multiple matched/nested case-control studies. There are two files containing the R functions, one for the conditional logistic regression model with an interaction term of the biomarker exposure with another covariate, and the other without the interaction term. See our manuscript below for details.
